# Social-Relationship-Questionnaire-Qualtrics
This is a repo so I can track my progress of creating a script to deal with the Social Relationship Data. 

This script will take the Qualtrics output - one line per subject with a lot of columns for each question per node - and transform it to a dataframe with one line per subject per node in their network.
